## 📌 Project Overview

In today’s digital world, hiding and decrypting sensitive information securely is critical. This project implements:

- **LSB-based Steganography Tool** to hide/extract ciphertext in images.
- **Neural Network-Based Cryptanalysis Tool** to detect cipher type and decrypt it.
- **Unified framework** for image analysis, feature extraction, and decryption.
